# Hi there!

I’m a passionate technology enthusiast and aspiring full stack developer. My journey into coding began at DevAcademy, where I immersed myself in web development. I thrive on solving complex problems and transforming ideas into functional applications. I have honed my skills in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Express.js, gaining a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development. My experience includes working with APIs, managing databases, and practicing test-driven development. I enjoy collaborating with others and using Git and GitHub to bring projects to life.

I’m always eager to learn new technologies and stay updated on industry trends. I believe in the power of technology to drive innovation and improve lives, and I’m excited to contribute to projects that make a difference. When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech news, working on personal projects, or enjoying a good book.

Feel free to connect with me or check out my work!
