      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you

      When I had a role being a support representative in finance there were
      times when I had the ability to give financial advice to customers however
      this was not in the scope of a support representative. Also you needed
      specific qualifations to provide this financial advice. Customers would
      still ask for finanacial advice and whilst at times I thought I could
      provide them with a decent answer I had to make the ethical decision and
      tell customers that I am not able to provide this advice. With time I
      reflect on this as making the correct decision.
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.

      I think I am quite a good learner if the material provided is sufficient
      and I am able to ask questions if required and I think this will help me
      in my learning.

    <div class="text">
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </div>

    <div class="learning">
      It can take time for me to learn concepts if I do not intuitively
      understand them. In cases like these I will need to spend more focused
      time on these concepts.
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.
    </div>

    <div class="learning">
      In University there were many group projects and in a few cases not every
      person in the team provided a sufficient effort. In times like these I
      would have discussions with them and ask if they needed help and if the
      could still contribute which was effective. Relfecting on this I would
      have offered my help earlier.
